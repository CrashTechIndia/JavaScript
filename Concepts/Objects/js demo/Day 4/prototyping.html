<!-- 	
protoype vs classes
	> a  concept in js which lets us build objects using templates or a blueprint
	> the way we create objects using blueprint is using classes
	> but js dosn't have the concept of classes, what is does have is prototype concept.
	> however it does not act completely like classes because we do not create instances of prototype but we can add and manitulate behaviours of prototypes.
	> in other languages, object are created of some class, however, in js we have seen that it's not the case. obj in js need not be depended on any class
	> the traditional concept of having methods in classes dosent apply here, 
	  objects in js don't have methods as such, objects have properties.(another obj, primitive type, function)
